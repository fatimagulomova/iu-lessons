## DLBDSMLSL01 — Machine Learning Supervised Learning
The book begins with a gentle introduction to machine learning, providing context for the subsequent chapters. As it progresses, readers are gradually introduced to key supervised learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. Each algorithm is explained in a step-by-step manner, including practical examples and real-world use cases, ensuring that readers grasp the material with clarity.

## DLBDSMLUSL01 - Machine Learning—Unsupervised Learning and Feature Engineering
This book offers a concise, comprehensive guide to unsupervised machine learning and feature engineering concepts. Spanning six units, the book starts by laying a solid foundation in unsupervised learning, covering essential concepts such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. It then delves into feature engineering, a critical aspect of machine learning that significantly impacts model performance.
